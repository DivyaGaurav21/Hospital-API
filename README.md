  # Hospital Rest-API
## Description
 Weâ€™re going to design an API for the doctors of a Hospital which has been allocated by the
govt for testing and quarantine + well being of COVID-19 patients
- There can be 2 types of Users
- Doctors
- Patients
- Doctors can log in
- Each time a patient visits, the doctor will follow 2 steps
- Register the patient in the app (using phone    number, if the patient already exists, just
return the patient info in the API)
- After the checkup, create a Report
- Patient Report will have the following fields
- Created by doctor
- Status (patient status like:- fever , malaria etc):

The Routes here used in project
- /doctors/register â†’ with username and password
- /doctors/login â†’ returns the JWT to be used
- /patients/register
- /patients/:id/create-report
- /patients/:id/all_reports â†’ List all the reports of a patient oldest to latest
- /reports/:status â†’ List all the reports of all the patients filtered by a specific status
